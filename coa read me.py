I executed the code in Linprog, which is the name of sms.py. When you're going to run the code, just type python3 sms.py in the Linprog that finds your output. While comparing with the professor's output, kindly use the python3 sms.py >trace1.out and also compare that with the home/faculty/whalley/cda5155exec/memhier.exe < trace_phys.dat > trace. diff trace.out trace1.out: use this command and compare the output.
